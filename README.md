# RetroDebugger
A generic debugger library intended for emulator intergration.
Goal is to provide a common GDB like interface for debugging ROM binaries with integrated emulators.
As well as providing possibly common tools for aiding in debug of older computer/game ROMs running in a supported emulator.

RetroDebugger is a WIP library I'm developing in my spare time to run with my Gameboy emulator.
My personal goal is to use this project as a test bed to play with new C++ standards and to practice hopfully better coding practices.
Another goal is to become more acquainted with development tools and to improve my overall handling of personnal projects.
